All data files are hg19-ready (Human Genome Build 37).

All methylation files are from HAIB (HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology). It uses the Methyl 450K Bead Array Technology. Only one replicate is available.

All HAIB RNASeq files are from HAIB (obviously!). There should be two replicates and only the corrected datasets are used.
